# CHANGE LOG

## v0.2.1
Pretty much all changes due, with thanks, to the lore mastery, creativity, and play testing of SleightxHope!

### Races
* Now have alignments

### Classes

#### Infiltrators
**Shadow**
* Deadly Strike renamed Up Close and Personal, moved to 2nd level.
* Melee Specialist replaced with Silent Cloak. Moved to 9th level. Aligns with Supreme Sneak from D&D PHB.
* Tactical Ambush moved to Shadow subclass at the 14th level.

**Operative**
* Complete rework, all new skillz!

#### Sentinels
**Battlemaster**
* Renamed to Overwatch, with a focus on managing the battlefield. Quality justification from SleightxHope, "Think of 
Miranda Lawson, who is effectively a Sentinel without tech armor. She's a leader, giving orders from the front ... a 
Sentinel subclass that uses superior Heads Up Display tech to give the Sentinel a tech aura that lets them give split-second 
tactical info to their allies (Help action)."
* Using a variety of Rogue features plus new tactically oriented features.
* Battlemaster provides advanced option selection with all Tech/Biotics at the 10th level.

#### Soldiers
**General**
* Soldiers advance their fighting style 9th level.

#### Vanguards
**Slayer**
* Replace Melee Specialist with Biotic Bullrush.

### Feats
* A plethora of new feats!
* Melee Specialist removed form the Vanguard and Infiltrator Progression. Added as a feat.

### Spells
* Charge is now a spell attack, rather than a saving throw. Removed the shield regen mechanic and added it as a special 
feature of the new Vanguard class feature: Biotic Bullrush.
