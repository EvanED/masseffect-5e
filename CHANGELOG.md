# CHANGE LOG

## v0.3.0

### Weapon Refactor
See the post on the homepage for an more detailed explanation. In short, the weapons have been overhauled, reducing the overall damage spread.

New weapon type: Semi-automatic
When you make a ranged attack with this weapon, you can use your bonus action to make a second ranged attack. You do not add your Dexterity
modifier to the attack or damage roll. The second attack may be on the same or a different target.



Added melee weapons.

### Feats
* New Feat: Hair Trigger, gives you an advantage when using semi-automatic weapons.

### Classes

#### Class Features
* Removed the "Up close and personal" fighting style.
* Added the "Carnage" fighting style, which specifically buffs shotgun use.

#### Engineer
* Renamed "Kamakaze drone" to "Disruptor drone", more in line with [the game](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Disruption_Drone).
* Renamed "Support" sublcass to "Medic", more in line with [the game](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Engineer#Class_Talent)

#### Vanguard
__Cabal__
Cabal reworked and renamed to Nemesis. Cabals are a very specific Turian Vanguard, so it didn't make much sense for them
to be a subclass. Nemesis are a biotic-oriented Vanguard.
* Nightshade blades is now a combat power available to Vanguards, Infiltrators, and Soldiers
* Poison Strike was removed and the mechanic added as an advancement option for Charge.
* Metabiotics added, allowing you to spend barrier ticks to enhance your spells.
* Vengeance added. Dying in battle may not be a bad idea...


__Slayer__
Slayer renamed to Shock Trooper, to better reflect [the game](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Vanguard#Class_Talent)
* Biotic Bullrush was revamped slightly, giving the aspects of the Charger feat when using Charge.

* Champion renamed to Battle Master to better reflect it's D&D counterpart.


#### Sentinel
* Removed 4th level spell slots from the progression table. Reflects that Sentinels are the least powerful of the biotic classes.
* Battle Master renamed to Mastermind, to better reflect their mastery of tactical situations.
  * Battle Master feat renamed to Tactical Advantage
* Paladin renamed to Guardian to better reflect the feature set (auras that guard allies).


### Spells & Powers
* Carnage renamed to "Beehive". Carnage is now a fighting style.
* Neural Shock updated, now a creature hit by neural shock can take reactions until the start of its next turn.
* Flare and Dominate changed to level 4 and Singularity changed to level 3 to better reflect the required biotic control.
* With a few exceptions, damage for all damage dealing biotic spells have been adjusted to fit the following criteria:
    - Cantrips: < 10 avg damage
    - 1st Level: 10-15 avg damage
    - 2nd level: 15 - 22 avg damage
    - 3rd level: 20 - 28 avg damage
    - 4th level: 25-35 avg damage
This change was made to add a bit more scaling to the spells, as 4th level spells are effectively 6-7th level D&D spells.

#### New Spells & Powers
__Tech__
* Snap Freeze
* Salvo
* Guidance
* Poison Spray
* Shocking Grasp
* Target Painting
* Unity
* Counterspell

__Biotic__
* Biotic Wall
* Storm
* Backlash
* Catapult
* Alter Center Mass
* Fly

__Combat__
* Fortification




## v0.2.1
Pretty much all changes due, with thanks, to the lore mastery, creativity, and play testing of SleightxHope!

### Skills
* Removed Xenology. There was too much crossover between Medicine, History, and Xenology. Medicine is used for organic biology
checks (alien or no), history is culture, politics, legends, lore, etc (alien or no)

### Races
* Now have alignments

### Classes

### Engineers
**Demolisher**
* Moved 2nd level Makeshift Grenades from 18 to 14.
* Replaced 14th level talent Targeting Mobility with new, more powerful talent Paint by Number.

#### Infiltrators
**Shadow**
* Deadly Strike renamed Up Close and Personal, moved to 2nd level.
* Melee Specialist replaced with Silent Cloak. Moved to 9th level. Aligns with Supreme Sneak from D&D PHB.
* Tactical Ambush moved to Shadow subclass at the 14th level.

**Operative**
* Complete rework, all new skillz!

#### Sentinels
**Battlemaster**
* Renamed to Overwatch, with a focus on managing the battlefield. Quality justification from SleightxHope, "Think of 
Miranda Lawson, who is effectively a Sentinel without tech armor. She's a leader, giving orders from the front ... a 
Sentinel subclass that uses superior Heads Up Display tech to give the Sentinel a tech aura that lets them give split-second 
tactical info to their allies (Help action)."
* Using a variety of Rogue features plus new tactically oriented features.
* Battlemaster provides advanced option selection with all Tech/Biotics at the 10th level.

#### Soldiers
**General**
* Soldiers advance their fighting style 9th level.

#### Vanguards
**Slayer**
* Replace Melee Specialist with Biotic Bullrush.

### Feats
* A plethora of new feats!
* Melee Specialist removed form the Vanguard and Infiltrator Progression. Added as a feat.

### Spells
* Charge is now a spell attack, rather than a saving throw. Removed the shield regen mechanic and added it as a special 
feature of the new Vanguard class feature: Biotic Bullrush.
