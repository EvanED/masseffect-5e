## Shoutout
Major thanks to [SleightxHope](https://github.com/SleightxHope) for jumping into Github and contributing a ton of ideas.
Backgrounds, skills, armor, weapon mods, class rewrites! Can't say thanks enough for the collaboration and playtesting!

## Where did the old one go?
For anyone that wants the old version, click on the
version number in the upper-right of the main nav and 
select "[v0.1.0-alpha]({site.github.url}/v1/)".

## Why so much change?
One major issue was that almost all classes peaked around lvl 9. I started using
[spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTyqV8mnMFzRexQ_pEMnX1-BFRqFt3Jb_uCBjjY3nUdPCMbNT0dXc7Nkd4tIlZlzjv4NuR6xB44Euqd/pubhtml) 
to track damage progression throughout levels. FYI - Those bad boys are sorely
out of date, as I threw in a host of changes last minute. But that's the documentation
for how the new classes stack up damage wise. It's really just proof that
I put in _some_ amount of time trying to balance this system out.

The other major issue is that I wanted this conversion to reflect D&D 5th Edition
as much as it could. I'd spent too much time coming up with random abilities and class features
rather than lean back on the amazing work WoC does. So, in this iteration, I focused
on taking subclass features from 5e and sticking them in at appropriate levels. There is
still plenty of homebrew content, but the classes should have a much more familiary feel than before.

## Player's Handbook
To keep things more sustainable, I've completely rewritten the [player's handbook]({site.github.url}/phb/) into a single page webapp. This site 
will now exist to keep people updated on news, play testing, and other miscellaneous items, like printable character sheets
and spell cards.

## Changes

### Rules

Other than the change to paragon and renegade, the only rule changes were clarifications and restructuring the handbook 
for better rule navigation.

### Paragon & Renegade
