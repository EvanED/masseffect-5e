  notes: Somewhat of a relic, the M-7 does not use thermal clips. Instead use a d4
    to track the "heat". Every round you fire the weapon, spin down the die 1 face.
    If you don't fire the weapon, spin the die up one face. Thsi represents the weapon
    internally cooling off. If you fire the weapon 4 times in a row, it jams and cannot
    be used for the rest of this combat.
