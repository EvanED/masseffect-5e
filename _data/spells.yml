    start with the power Adrenaline Rush, which is powered by Adrenaline Dice (AD),
    a d4 die. You regain 1 AD on a short rest, and all your AD on a long rest. On
    your turn, you can activate Adrenaline Rush as a bonus action. When you activate
    Adrenaline Rush, choose and execute an available feature or spell. Features explain
    how the die roll relates to the ability. For spells, the roll of the d4 represents
    the level at which you cast the spell. For tech powers, the roll counts as the
    number of tech points you spend to cast the ability. Spells cannot do LESS damage
    (i.e., rolling a 1 on a level 4 spell), but they have the potential to do more
    damage. This using the AD is considered the bonus action, you can still take another
    action this turn.
