    Adrenaline Rush, choose and execute an available feature or spell. Features explain
    how the die roll relates to the ability. For spells, the roll of the d4 represents
    the level at which you cast the spell. For tech powers, the roll counts as the
    number of tech points you spend to cast the ability. Spells cannot do LESS damage
